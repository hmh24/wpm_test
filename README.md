# wpm_test

Live Demo: https://wpm-test.herokuapp.com/


 A full stack web application built using Django and React that allows users to test their typing speed, as well as login/registerto track their progress.  Inspired by typeracer.com, I started this project just as a means to introduce myself to React, but eventually decided to add some backend functionality with Django and Django Rest framework. Users can create an account, where their scores from each game will be stored. Give it a try!
